Here is my first project in LetsGrowMore internship,

About project:-

        In this project i created a machine learning model for predict a species of flower based on their SepalLength, SepalWidth, PetalLength and PetalWidth.
First i understand how final machine learning project is creating by data scientist and which steps are perform for it.

1.  Collecting data and read that data by using pandas dataframe.

2.  Understanding what our data is containing like shape of dataset, dtypes, describe.

3.  Delete unnecessary column or data which are not required for our machine learning model here i deleted column ID because it is not needed to predict flower speceis.

4.  Understand relation between all columns by using Correlation.

5.  We have to clarify that our target column is categorical data or continues data by getting this information we can perform different task on dataset.

6.  Here we have categorical data as target data so we have to do categorical encoding of species column because we have species in string data type so we have to 
    convert string to interger.
    
7.  So we can apply dummies method for categorical encoding.

8.  Then we can clean our dataset.

9.  So now we can visualize our data in charts and bars form by python libraries like Matplotlib, seaborn and plotly otherwise we can use power bi tool for visualize 
    our data.
    
10. Here i used power bi tool for visualize my dataset and get insights from it.

11. Now we perform data split task on dataset for seperate our dependent variables and independent variable(Target variable) here our target variable is species column.

12. Then we can perfrom diffent machine learning algorithms on data like:-
    i)   Logistic regression
    ii)  Decision tree
    iii) Random forest
    iv)  Support Vector Machine(SVM)
    v)   Naive bayes 
    vi)  Gradient Boosting
    
13. After appling above machine learning algorithms we get accuracy which are given below:-
    i)   Logistic regression         :- 97.37 %
    ii)  Decision tree               :- 94.74 %
    iii) Random forest               :- 94.74 %
    iv)  Support Vector Machine(SVM) :- 94.73 %
    v)   Naive bayes                 :- 92.10 %
    vi)  Gradient Boosting           :- 94.73 %
    
14. Now we test our model by giving values of SepalLength, SepalWidth, PetalLength and PetalWidth.
